The **Parking Lot Reservation App** is a console-based Java application for managing parking slot reservations across multiple zones. The system uses a 2D array `parkingStructure` to track Zone A (10 compact slots), Zone B (14 standard slots), and requires adding Zone C (8 luxury slots). Key implementation tasks include: completing the `VehicleOwner` class with proper encapsulation (private fields: ownerName, vehicleRegistration, contactNumber plus constructor, getters/setters), implementing the `registerOwner()` method to collect user input and store owner objects in a global array, adding search functionality by vehicle registration, and completing the `saveToFile()` method to write parking data and owner details to "ParkingData.txt". The app demonstrates core Software Development II concepts: array manipulation, object-oriented programming, file I/O operations, menu-driven interfaces, and linear search algorithms. Main focus areas for exam preparation are Zone C expansion, VehicleOwner class completion, method implementation (registerOwner, search, saveToFile), and proper encapsulation principles.
